# cowboy game
COWBOY was my first game but I will move on to other
projects because the game was
combined with many things that made it 
unscripted in an unfinished way. 
Or is it because I don't know how to code and
I'm a NOOB so maybe I'll go back to that in the 
meantime I'll create new projects in LOVE2D.
